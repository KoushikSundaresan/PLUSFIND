## Issues Found & Fixed

### üîß **Dependency Issues**
- **Fixed**: React-leaflet v5.0.0 compatibility with React 18
- **Solution**: Downgraded to react-leaflet v4.2.1 for compatibility
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

### üîß **TypeScript Issues**
- **Fixed**: Multiple `any` type usage
- **Fixed**: Empty interface declarations
- **Fixed**: Missing type definitions for route planning
- **Solution**: Added proper type interfaces (`SimplifiedRoutePlan`, `GeocodingResult`)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

### üîß **Code Quality Issues**
- **Fixed**: ESLint warnings about component exports
- **Fixed**: Leaflet icon TypeScript compatibility
- **Fixed**: Tailwind config import issues
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Mostly resolved (some warnings remain but non-blocking)

### üîß **Build Issues**
- **Fixed**: Application now builds successfully
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

## Current Application Status

### ‚úÖ **Working Features**
1. **Application boots and runs successfully**
2. **EV model selection with detailed specifications**
3. **Interactive map with charging stations**
4. **Route planning interface**
5. **API key configuration system**
6. **Responsive design and animations**
7. **Build process completes successfully**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**
1. **Mock data**: Without API keys, uses simulated data
2. **Limited real-time features**: Weather and routing are simulated

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Privacy**
- No sensitive data stored
- API keys stored in localStorage (user-managed)
- All APIs used are free and safe
- No tracking or analytics

## How to Use the Application

### 1. **Setup & Installation**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### 2. **Configuration (Optional)**
- Configure free API keys in the app for enhanced features:
  - OpenRouteService: 2,000 requests/day free
  - OpenWeatherMap: 1,000 calls/day free
- Without keys, the app uses mock data

### 3. **Planning a Route**
1. Select your EV model from the dropdown
2. Set your current State of Charge (SOC)
3. Enter origin and destination
4. Click "Plan Optimal Route"
5. View charging stops and energy analysis

### 4. **Exploring Charging Stations**
- Click on map markers to view station details
- Green markers = Available stations
- Red markers = Occupied stations
- Station popup shows network, power, and amenities

## Recommended Next Steps
